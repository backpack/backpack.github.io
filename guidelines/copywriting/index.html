You might even give yourself a pat on the back (but, um, make sure no-one is looking first).</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Still, if we&#x27;re going to help people, we need to make sure they&#x27;re listening.

They might have lots of good knowledge, but you&#x27;re probably not going to listen to them. (Same goes for if they&#x27;re really snobby, or obviously thinks they&#x27;re just, like, too cool. Blergh.)</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Now imagine you met someone really funny and entertaining. But the things they told you were just plain wrong.

Our content is only helpful if it features personalised tips, recommendations and insight from people with on-the-ground experience.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Sure, we can sort of figure out what a place looks like and where the hot restaurants are with a bit of internet research. But can we give the details that make the difference? Do we know which bars are worth the hype? Do we know if the hotel really is a short walk from the train station, or a long, dangerous hike through a dodgy neighbourhood?</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">We want to help people have the best trip ever. We can&#x27;t do that with guesswork. Do we want to send someone to that dodgy neighbourhood, because the hotel website made it look nicer? No. We patted ourselves on the back already! We want to be heroes.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">PS: Not to sound too much like teacher, but it&#x27;s a good idea to check spellings. We could give someone the most amazing recommendation, but if we spell it wrong, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll remember, and it makes people trust us less.</p><h2 class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--xl-2Yjen bpkdocs-mdx-page__heading-h2-3NrUM" id="how-do-you-find-the-right-voice-">How do you find the right voice?</h2><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">We want your voice to be very personal but, when we&#x27;re writing editorial, it also needs to represent Skyscanner and complement who we are, and the things we believe. Here&#x27;s how we would describe ourselves:</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>&quot;We&#x27;re straightforward.&quot;</strong> We don&#x27;t show off with big words.

We understand travel - what&#x27;s worth the effort, what&#x27;s truly exceptional, what will hopefully make people happy and what might not.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>&quot;We love travel and we want others to love it just as much.&quot;</strong> Exploring the world is a magical thing.

If we say, &#x27;The hotel is a short walk from the train station,&#x27; that&#x27;s pretty vague - what do we mean by &#x27;short&#x27;? But if we say, &#x27;The hotel is a mile&#x27;s walk (with lots of steps, be prepared if you&#x27;ve got kids) from the train station&#x27;, we&#x27;re giving people information they can use.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>Make it easy to understand</strong>. The best writing doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re trying to be too clever - it just sounds natural. Say what you mean, and say it clearly - like you would to a friend.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>Make it personal</strong>. Why should people trust us? Use your experience to show them you know what you&#x27;re talking about. &#x27;The food was delicious,&#x27; doesn&#x27;t tell anyone anything, really. Instead try, &#x27;The restaurant fuses Italian and Californian flavours. Their short rib with gnocchi is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever tasted: really smoky and rich.&#x27;</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>Be interesting</strong>. Travel is exciting, so we shouldn&#x27;t make it sound boring. &#x27;The museum has lots of historical artifacts&#x27; = zzzzz. But &#x27;the museum is awesome - I saw a collection of real-life shrunken heads&#x27; sounds pretty interesting, doesn&#x27;t it?</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>Be honest</strong>. We want people to make informed choices. So if there&#x27;s something you think might bother people, tell them. So you might say: &#x27;This hotel is great: friendly staff, comfy beds and value for money. But you will need to be comfortable with shared bathrooms.&#x27; Or: &#x27;This is one of the best hotels I&#x27;ve ever stayed in - but it&#x27;s also one of the most expensive.&#x27;</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Operate on the goldilocks principle.

Recommended.&quot;</em></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">OK, so it&#x27;s a fantastic location and the atmosphere is incredible - but why?</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Great, the food is delicious - but what was it like, and what did you order?</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">Yay, the prices are reasonable!

Don&#x27;t miss the raan: an unbelievably tender roast leg of lamb (I think I actually drooled on it). This is a pricier option than your usual Indian restaurant - dishes start at about 500 rupees (Â£6) - but the quality, portions and setting are worth it.&quot;</em></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>An anecdote achieves a lot more than a throwaway statement. So, instead of saying <em>&quot;Service is spot on&quot;</em>, you might say, <em>&quot;Service is fast and thoughtful - our waiter warned us about the really spicy dishes and our water glass never got empty.&quot;</em></strong></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">All in all, if you just follow the rules, it&#x27;s pretty simple.

The city invented everything from the farm-to-table food movement, to the Big Tech sharing economy (Uber and Airbnb were born here), and is a gay rights pioneer. That means the city always feels exciting: whether you&#x27;re queuing for the new flavour at gourmet ice cream shop Salt &amp; Straw, or just got a ticket to The Colour Factory, where the rooms are full of balloons and rainbow-coloured ribbons. Plus, SF (only tourists call it &#x27;San Fran&#x27;!) is packed with iconic landmarks, like its historic cable cars, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz island. There are also loads of hands-on museums (feel your way around the &#x27;Tactile Room&#x27; at Exploratorium, or enter an indoor rainforest at California Academy of Sciences). Even better, this compact city only measures seven miles by seven miles, so it&#x27;s super-easy to explore.&quot;</em></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">We also want to give advice about <strong>the best time to visit</strong>, because this really affects a trip. It&#x27;s no fun if, say, all the best stuff is outdoors, and you visit when it&#x27;s raining. Think about all the factors the best time to visit might include: when things are open, how busy or expensive it is, any festivals or events. Personal tips from your own experience are especially useful here, when you&#x27;re writing the <strong>&#x27;When to go?&#x27;</strong> section.</p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>For example:</strong></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><em>&quot;The major mistake people make is visiting San Francisco in summer. May to August actually gets pretty chilly and foggy - in fact, the fog often covers the Golden Gate Bridge completely. September and October, though, are perfect, with clear blue skies and temperatures in the high 20s. Surrounded by green hills and sea, San Francisco is one of the world&#x27;s best-looking cities, offering lots of amazing views, and gorgeous parks that look their best in the sunshine.&quot;</em></p><h2 class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--xl-2Yjen bpkdocs-mdx-page__heading-h2-3NrUM" id="how-to-write-safety-tips">How to write safety tips</h2><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-"><strong>On some destination pages, we give safety tips for LGBTQ and solo female travellers.</strong></p><p class="bpk-text-g4cOk bpk-text--base-BUoym bpk-docs-paragraph-3HDk-">This doesn&#x27;t mean trying to scare anyone; but it doesn&#x27;t mean glossing over anything, either.
